      <p>Onions are a staple in Gulf kitchens, from home cooking to large-scale food processing. For importers in the Gulf region, ensuring consistent quality, long shelf life, and compliance with local regulations is critical.</p>
      <p>India, as a major onion exporter, has built systems to meet these standards—but working with the right partner can make all the difference.</p>
      <p><strong>At TwinRoots International</strong>, we specialize in providing Gulf importers with onions that meet every expectation for taste, quality, and compliance.</p>

      <h2>Meeting Gulf Market Requirements</h2>
      <p>Gulf countries have specific standards for imported onions, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Size and Uniformity:</strong> Sorted by size and weight for retail and industrial buyers.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Moisture Content:</strong> Properly cured onions (under 6% moisture) prevent spoilage in transit.</li>
        <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Clean, firm, blemish-free, and sprout-free onions only.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> Export-ready mesh bags or cartons that preserve freshness.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Phytosanitary certificates and APEDA registration ensure regulatory alignment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By focusing on these parameters, importers can minimize losses and ensure peak condition upon arrival.</p>
