      <p>Onions are one of the most traded vegetables in the world, used daily in homes, restaurants, and food industries. For buyers, India has become a preferred source due to its scale, diversity, and strong export ecosystem. But before you begin importing, here’s what you need to know to make the most of India’s onion supply.</p>

      <h2>India’s Role in the Global Onion Trade</h2>
      <p>India is the second-largest onion producer globally, accounting for about 25% of world output. In 2022–23, the country produced over 31 million metric tons, with exports reaching more than 2.5 million tons. Major producing regions like Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Karnataka are known for high-quality onions that meet global demand.</p>
      <p>At TwinRoots International, we source directly from trusted farmers in these regions, ensuring consistent size, flavour, and storage life tailored to different markets.</p>

      <h2>Onion Varieties to Know</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Red Onions</strong> – Strong flavor, widely exported to Asia and the Middle East.</li>
        <li><strong>White Onions</strong> – Milder taste, ideal for Western markets and processed foods.</li>
        <li><strong>Yellow Onions</strong> – Balanced flavor, popular for bulk exports.</li>
        <li><strong>Shallots</strong> – Smaller, sweeter onions used in gourmet cuisines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Choosing the right variety is essential depending on your market’s food habits and preferences.</p>

      <h2>Meeting Global Standards</h2>
      <p>Onions are perishable and sensitive to handling, making quality control critical. India’s export industry has established strong post-harvest systems including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grading for size and appearance</li>
        <li>Proper curing for extended shelf life</li>
        <li>Export-ready packaging using mesh bags or jute sacks</li>
        <li>Compliance with international food safety norms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>TwinRoots International takes an active role in monitoring every stage from farm collection to shipment, ensuring that consignments reach you in top condition.</p>

      <h2>Global Demand and Opportunities</h2>
      <p>The global onion market is projected to grow steadily, with rising consumption in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. India remains a reliable exporter due to production scale and competitive pricing.</p>
      <p>Importers benefit not just from supply volume but also from India’s ability to cater to different seasonal demands. With an experienced partner like TwinRoots International, you can minimize disruptions and secure a steady supply.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>India’s onions stand out for their availability, variety, and cost-effectiveness. For importers, the key lies in finding the right partner who can deliver not only the product but also trust, consistency, and long-term value.</p>
      <p>At TwinRoots International, we’re committed to being that partner.
