      <p>Chillies are among the most widely traded spices worldwide, valued for their heat, colour, and flavour. India plays a major role in this market, exporting a wide range of chilli varieties to over 160 countries.</p>
      <p>For importers, understanding key quality parameters is essential to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and market expectations. At TwinRoots International, we believe informed buyers make reliable trade partners. Here are the most critical factors to evaluate:</p>

      <h2>1. Pungency (Capsaicin Content)</h2>
      <p>The heat of chillies is measured in Scoville Heat Units (SHU), which reflect capsaicin concentration. Indian varieties like Guntur and Byadgi range from moderately hot to extremely pungent. Buyers should specify SHU levels based on market needs such as household use, food processing, or sauces.</p>

      <h2>2. Colour Value</h2>
      <p>Colour is measured using ASTA units. Higher values indicate a brighter red appearance, preferred by industries using natural colouring. Byadgi chillies, for example, offer high colour value with medium pungency. TwinRoots International ensures exports meet international colour standards.</p>

      <h2>3. Moisture Content</h2>
      <p>Properly dried chillies should have moisture levels below 12% to avoid spoilage and fungal growth during transit. Pre-shipment moisture testing ensures long shelf life and safe delivery.</p>

      <h2>4. Absence of Aflatoxins</h2>
      <p>Aflatoxins, produced by certain fungi, are a strict food safety concern. The EU and US FDA enforce maximum limits in imported chillies. We partner only with farms and processing units that conduct regular lab testing to ensure compliance.</p>

      <h2>5. Physical Appearance</h2>
      <p>High-quality chillies must be well-dried, uniform in shape, pest-free, and free from stems, dust, or stones. Discolouration or broken pods lower grade and market value. Packaging in jute or polypropylene bags helps preserve quality during transport.</p>

      <h2>6. Certifications and Traceability</h2>
      <p>Importers increasingly require certifications like APEDA registration, Spice Board of India approval, and phytosanitary clearances. These documents ensure compliance with domestic and international regulations.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>India offers unmatched diversity and appeal in chilli exports, but quality assurance is critical to a successful trade. By monitoring factors like heat level, colour, moisture, aflatoxin control, and certification, buyers protect both their investment and reputation.</p>
      <p>At TwinRoots International, we ensure every chilli shipment is tested, compliant, and export-ready. If you’re seeking a sourcing partner who values reliability as much as you do, we’d be glad to connect.</p>
